Yet another chrome ext for simulate emacs keys

But I want to keep it simple and small.

##Default keys:
###  Move
* `C-n`: next line
* `C-p`: prior line
* `C-e`: right of page
* `C-a`: left of page
* `C-v`: page down
* `C-v`: page up
* `M-shift->`: move to bottom
* `M-shift-<`: move to top
* `C-b`: back history
* `C-f`: forward history

### Tab
* `M-n`: next tab
* `M-p`: previous tab

### Open links
* `C-x C-f`: show links
* `number enter`: go to that link

Keys already supported by the browser/OS won't  include in this ext.

##TODO:
* C / M key customized
